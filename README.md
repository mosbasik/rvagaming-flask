rvagaming-flask
===============

A work-in-progress from-scratch rewrite of github.com/mosbasik/rvagaming using the Flask Python web framework.

# To use this project:

* Make sure you have at least Python 2.7 installed

* Make sure you have the Python module `virtualenv` installed (You will need to download and install this for any version of Python older than 3.4).

  * You might be able to get it using a package from your distribution.  For instance, on Ubuntu:

  ```
  sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv
  ```

  * Otherwise, the easiest way is to install `pip` and use that to get `virtualenv`:

  ```
  pip install virtualenv
  ```

* Make a folder for your app

```
mkdir app
```
*
